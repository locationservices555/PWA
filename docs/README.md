We are still building this template to make it even much better and easier to config. Meanwhile, Man's Got To CODE 😜😝 !
[Fork this project](https://github.com/pwafire/codelab/fork) and create your codelab. After curating it and ready, we got to get it [published here](https://pwafire.org/developer/codelabs/) 😍

    Do not forget to edit this important lines of code; which describes what your codelab is all about
    
 ```html
